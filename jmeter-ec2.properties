# Suggested AMIs
#
# OS          Type   AMI id        User       Available sizes
# Ubuntu	    64bit  ami-e1e8d395  ubuntu     t1.micro, m1.small, m1.medium, c1.medium, m1.large, m1.xlarge, etc.
#
# IMPORTANT - t1.micro is not recommend for anything beyond developement, it works from a shared resource pool that can fluctuate, skewing test results.
#
REMOTE_HOME="/tmp"                          # This can be left as /tmp - it is a temporary working location
AMI_ID="ami-e1e8d395"                       # A suitable AMI - 2 suggested AMIs are listed above. (Tested OK with SUSE Linux 32 & 64 bit.). Dont forget to find the right ID for your region.
INSTANCE_TYPE="t1.micro"                    # Should match the AMI - I do not recommend usng micros for live tests but it's useful for dev work
INSTANCE_SECURITYGROUPS="jmeter,vpc-ssh"    # The name OR id of *your* security group in *your* Amazon account - clearly this needs to give your local machine ssh access.
AMAZON_KEYPAIR_NAME="olloyd-eu"	            # The name of the Amazon Keypair that you want to use. This kea/usery should exist in IAM.
PEM_FILE="olloyd-eu.pem"                    # The full name of the pem file you downloaded from your Amazon account. Usualy .pem from AWS but you could generate your own and name it what you want.
PEM_PATH=$HOME/.ssh                         # The path to your pem file
USER="ubuntu"                               # Should match the AMI
EMAIL=""									                  # Email to be used when tagging instances
REGION="eu-west-1"			    			          # Specify the region you will be working in. Required so that we can find the right ami in the right availability zone.
INSTANCE_AVAILABILITYZONE="eu-west-1b"      # Should match the AMI and be available in the region above.
RUNNINGTOTAL_INTERVAL="3"                   # How often the script prints running totals to the screen (n * summariser.interval seconds)
ELASTIC_IPS=""                              # A list of static IPs that can be assigned to each ec2 host. Ignored if not set.
REMOTE_PORT="22"                            # The port number sshd is running on,
JMETER_VERSION="apache-jmeter-2.7"          # The version of JMeter to be used. Must be the full name used in the dir structure. Does not work for versions prior to 2.5.1.
JAVA_VERSION_32='jre-6u32-linux-i586.bin'   # Specify the JAVA binary you will be using in the case of 32Bit.
JAVA_VERSION_64='jre-6u32-linux-x64.bin'    # Specify the JAVA binary you will be using in the case of 64Bit.


#
# EC2-VPC Usage
#
# jmeter-ec2 can configure EC2-VPC instances. You must:
#   - set SUBNET_ID to the id of the subnet that the instance will belong to
#   - set INSTANCE_SECURITYGROUP to be the id of the security group, rather than the name of the security group
#   - make sure that the AMI is compatible with EC2-VPC
#   - enable DNS Resolution in the VPC
#   - enable DNS hostnames in the VPC
#
SUBNET_ID=""                 # The subnet that the instance will belong to.

# REMOTE_HOSTS
#
# If this is set then the script will ignore INSTANCE_COUNT passed in at the command line and read in this list of hostnames to run the test over
# instead. If it is not set then n number of hosts will be requested from Amazon.
#
# Must be a comma-separated list, like this:
# REMOTE_HOSTS="ec2-46-51-135-180.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com,ec2-176-34-204-10.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com"
# or:
# REMOTE_HOSTS="myhost.com,antherhost.com"
# or:
# REMOTE_HOSTS="blahblah.corp.synergy:2020,10.213.45.6"
# etc.

# DATABASE SETTINGS
# If specified, then the script will import the results to the mysql database given here
